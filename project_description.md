### üß† Gemma 3n Integration: The Heart of My Solution

#### üéØ Model Selection and Optimization
We specifically chose **Gemma 3n:e2b** for several critical technical reasons:

**1. Mobile-First Design**: Gemma 3n is Google's first open model designed for on-device inference, making it ideal for the offline-first requirements.

**2. Efficient Memory Usage**: The model runs efficiently on consumer hardware (tested on 8GB RAM + RTX 4060), crucial for accessibility.

**3. Specialized Prompting Strategy**: My implementation uses carefully crafted system prompts:

```python
system_prompt = f"You're an expert Idiom Interpreter & Translator. Your job is to translate idioms and figurative expressions into {target_language}, preserving their cultural and emotional meaning. Always give the translation directly, without extra explanation or commentary."
```

This approach ensures **contextually accurate translations** rather than literal word-for-word conversion.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Configuration to call **Ollama**
```python
llm = OLLamaLLMService(
    model="gemma3n:e2b",
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",
    params=OLLamaLLMService.InputParams(
        temperature=0.7,    # Balanced creativity/consistency
        max_tokens=1000     # Sufficient for complex translations
    )
)
```

### üí™ Critical Technical Challenges Overcome

#### üé§ 1. Real-Time Audio Processing Pipeline
**Challenge**: Creating a seamless audio-to-translation pipeline with minimal latency.

**Solution**: Implemented Pipecat AI framework with optimized pipeline architecture:
```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    pipecat_transport.input(),      # WebRTC audio input
    rtvi,                          # Real-time voice interface
    stt,                           # Whisper transcription
    context_aggregator.user(),     # User context management
    llm,                           # Gemma 3n translation
    pipecat_transport.output(),    # WebRTC output
    context_aggregator.assistant() # Assistant response tracking
])
```

#### üåê 2. WebRTC Connection Management
**Challenge**: Maintaining stable real-time connections with proper resource cleanup.

**Solution**: Custom connection pooling with automatic lifecycle management:
```python
# Store connections by pc_id for reuse
pcs_map: Dict[str, SmallWebRTCConnection] = {}

@pipecat_connection.event_handler("closed")
async def handle_disconnected(webrtc_connection: SmallWebRTCConnection):
    logger.info(f"Discarding peer connection for pc_id: {webrtc_connection.pc_id}")
    pcs_map.pop(webrtc_connection.pc_id, None)
```

#### üó£Ô∏è 3. Multi-Language Speech Recognition
**Challenge**: Accurate speech-to-text across 10+ languages with dynamic language switching.

**Solution**: Dynamic Whisper configuration with language-aware parameters:
```python
stt_params = {
    "model": Model.LARGE_V3_TURBO,  # Best accuracy/speed balance
    "device": "cuda",               # GPU acceleration when available
    "compute_type": "float16",      # Memory optimization
    "no_speech_prob": 0.3,         # Optimized speech detection
    "language": source_language     # Dynamic language assignment
}
```

#### üì± 4. Offline Operation Requirements
**Challenge**: Ensuring complete offline functionality while maintaining performance.

**Solution**: Local-first architecture with zero external dependencies:
- Ollama serves Gemma 3n locally on `localhost:11434`
- All processing happens on-device
- No external API calls or internet requirements

### üîç Technical Architecture Deep Dive

#### üñ•Ô∏è Backend Implementation (`server.py` & `bot.py`)

**FastAPI Server Design**:
- Asynchronous request handling for concurrent user sessions
- RESTful `/api/offer` endpoint for WebRTC negotiation
- Proper resource cleanup with `asynccontextmanager`
- Language parameter injection via query strings

**Pipecat Integration**:
The bot implementation showcases sophisticated audio processing:
```python
stt = WhisperSTTService(**stt_params)  # Speech recognition
llm = OLLamaLLMService(...)           # AI translation
context = OpenAILLMContext(messages)  # Conversation state
```

#### üíª Frontend Implementation (`app.ts`)

**Real-Time Communication**:
```typescript
this.pcClient = new PipecatClient({
  transport: new SmallWebRTCTransport({ connectionUrl }),
  enableMic: true,
  enableCam: false,
  callbacks: {
    onUserTranscript: (transcript) => this.logTranscript(transcript.text, true),
    onBotTranscript: (data) => this.logTranscript(data.text, false),
    // ... additional real-time event handlers
  }
});
```

**State Management**: Sophisticated connection lifecycle management with proper UI synchronization.

#### üé® User Experience Engineering
